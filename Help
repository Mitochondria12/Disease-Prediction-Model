This is my first attempt at creating a machine learning model to predict disease status. The data comes from the kaggle competition Identifying Age-Related Conditions ICR.
My primary hypothesis is creating new data features in the form of eucdelian distance between samples with all the other samples. This will leak information into the model,
so we will learn the impacts of doing this.
My secondary hypothesis is creating a new data feature in the form of which K means cluster each group is part of for various different K mean classes, from 3- 10 classes.
